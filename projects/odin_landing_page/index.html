            The name tapir comes from a Brazilian word and refers to the thick skin.In addition to the lowland tapir, there are three other tapir species. 
            The Baird's tapir, which lives from Mexico to Ecuador, west of the Andes. The mountain tapir, which lives from Colombia to Peru and the creation tapir, which lives in Asia.
            The tapir belongs to the so-called unpaired-toed ungulates like the horse and rhino. The lowland tapir has four toes on each foreleg, while each hind leg has three toes.
            The lowland tapir usually lives alone and is mainly nocturnal. It travels through the rainforest on frequently used trails that it marks with urine. The tapir almost always stays near water or swamps, where it splashes around and rolls in mud to keep cool.
            The Indians in the Amazon rainforest hunt the tapir for its meat and use its skin for leather, so if the tapir feels threatened, it will seek out the water. The lowland tapir is a good swimmer and can stay underwater for long periods of time.
            This group of mammals is not thought to have changed significantly in the last 35 million years.
            The tapir can also probe an area 30 centimetres in diameter with its proboscis without moving its head or the rest of its body.
